        "Buildings are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions and energy consumption within urban areas. Energy benchmarking is the practice of buildings reporting their energy consumption to goverment agencies to calculate energy performance based on a buildings type and characteristics. This paper wants to address a lack in understanding of this benchmarking process which is based on open data. To do this, benchmarking is compared to current practices and the importance of each variable in energy consumption is determined to understand what variables are important in determining a buildings energy consumption."
